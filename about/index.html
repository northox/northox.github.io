        <h4>About Danny</h4>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Danny Fullerton, I live in Qu√©bec Canada - the french part of North America. 
          I work for the biggest railroad company in Canada as an
          Enterprise Security Architect and has Defensive Security Researcher at 
          <a href="https://mantor.org">Mantor Organization</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My work touches both extreme of the security field: deep technical problem and, on the
          other side, how sound security is brought and manage efficiently in an organization.

          I'm also involve in the community as an Open Source Developer for various security software.
          You can find my public work on <a href="https://github.com/northox">github</a>.

        <h4 id="pics">Pictures</h4>
        <p>
          The pictures in this blog are scenes from my trips and my neighborhood.
          They are taken from a simple smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do I put some total random
          pictures in a security blog? <i>Because I feel like it, that's all.</i>
