#### About me

I live in the French part of north America - Québec, Canada. More precisely, Montréal. I'm Cofounder and Defensive Security Researcher at [Mantor Organization](https://mantor.org) and work as an Enterprise Security Architect for the biggest railroad in Canada.

Oh, as you might have seen, I'm also a hobbyist photographer... on a budget. [See below](#pics).

#### Field of expertise

My work and interest touch both extreme of the security field:

*   Deep technical problems about how security is built into computers (Root of Trust, Security by Compartmentalization, Trusted Computing, Operating System architecture) and on the other end;
*   How sound security is brought up and managed efficiently in an organization. This has to do with economics, processes and culture.

The latter is where I spend most of my time but the former is what I'm mostly known for as I've been a speaker at different security conferences (e.g. [Hackfest.ca](hackfest.ca)). This should change in a near future.

I use a lot of Open Source software/hardware and give back by getting involved in the community as an Open Source developer. My public work can be found on [github](https://github.com/northox).

#### Pictures

The pictures in this blog are scenes from my trips and my neighborhood. I'm still using a simple smartphone.

Why do I put some total random pictures in a security blog? Simply because I feel like it. This is one of the very few activities I enjoy aside computer stuff and like using my shots as part of my work.

I've developed this new interest while being inspired by an [awesome developer](https://github.com/jmettraux) and friend on the other side of the globe (Japan) named [John Mettraux](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/) and a former IBM co-worker and friend, [Denis Dumouchel](http://dumouchel.ca/photos/).

If you're interested, for the moment you can find most of my pictures on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/northox/).

##### Validating my identity

All my keys are signed by my "Danny Fullerton Master Signing Key". This key as a high assurance level as it's only used for signing other keys and never exposed to network-enabled VMs under Qubes OS.

Make sure you use different sources to confirm the fingerprint, e.g. <a href="">twitter</a>, our <a href="">website</a>, in person (no it's not awkward, just inconvenient... that's what the web-of-trust is all about).
